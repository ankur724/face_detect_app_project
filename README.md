Problem statement:-
According to the present scenario as we can see in most schools and colleges attendance is taken manually due to which 5 to 10 minutes are wasted in this process of manual attendance, This time is very valuable for both students and professors. It must be used for teaching purposes only and also the class is only 50 minutes long. All of the students in the class are paying to be taught, and that money is being wasted. There are classes where attendance should be mandatory because of the nature of the course, small discussion classes for instance. However, teachers should not have attendance policies for a class that is larger than 15 or 20 people.
There is also a possibility of human error in taking attendance manually like fake attendance. There must be no chance of error if we automate this process of taking attendance. 
These are the problems when we have to take attendance manually. This problem results in a decrease in the efficiency and productivity of a class.
